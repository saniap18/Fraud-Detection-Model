The internship involved creating a fraud detection system using Machine Learning. The tasks include collecting and preprocessing transaction data, feature engineering to extract meaningful insights from transaction patterns. I trained two models, using Random Forest and Linear Regression, to distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions. Anomaly detection technique, Isolation Forest, was used to predict rare fraudulent events. A real-time monitoring system can be implemented to flag potential fraudulent transactions as they occur by deploying the optimized model.
